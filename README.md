# PROJECT : Create dictionary data structure with all methods

## IMPORTANCE
#### The project implements a Custom Dictionary in Python, mimicking the behavior of Python's built-in dictionary. It provides functionalities like adding, updating, retrieving, deleting key-value pairs, checking for keys, and more. Additionally, it includes a menu-based interactive interface for users to perform operations on the custom dictionary.

### The project is usefull as it provides:
#### Learning Tool: Helps beginners understand dictionary operations and their implementations.
#### Customization: Allows extending and customizing dictionary functionalities as needed.
#### Practice with Classes: Introduces object-oriented programming concepts through practical implementation.

### This is how users can get started with the Project
#### Clone or copy the Python script to your local machine.
#### Ensure Python is installed.
#### Run the script and interact with the menu to explore dictionary operations.

## Key features
#### Reinforces core programming concepts (loops, conditionals, input/output).
#### Introduces object-oriented principles like encapsulation and method reuse.
#### Simulates real-world use cases of dictionaries in data manipulation.

## About the code
#### We wraps Python's built-in dictionary functionalities with additional methods.
### The methods used in the custom dictionary are as follow
#### Add (1): Adds a key-value pair to the dictionary.
#### Get (2): Retrieves a value for a given key (optional default if key not found).
#### Delete (3): Removes a specific key and returns its value.
#### Pop (4): Removes and returns the last added key-value pair.
#### Contains (5): Checks if a key exists in the dictionary.
#### Size (6): Displays the number of items in the dictionary.
#### Clear (7): Clears all entries from the dictionary.
#### Keys (8): Lists all keys in the dictionary.
#### Values (9): Lists all values in the dictionary.
#### Items (10): Lists all key-value pairs as tuples.
#### Update (11): Updates the dictionary with new key-value pairs.
#### SetDefault (12): Sets a default value for a key if it doesn't exist.
#### Display (13): Prints the entire dictionary.
#### Exit (14): Exits the program.

#### The user interface is a menu-based console program.

### Purpose of the Code:
####  The code demonstrates how to implement a reusable, interactive system for dictionary management in Python. It simplifies operations and improves user interaction by encapsulating logic in a class and offering a menu-driven interface.
